Here's a step by step guide on how to get your EOCross skills from a beginner to a world class level.

<Steps>
### [Learn EO](/tutorial/eo)

Learn how to identify bad edges on the cube, and how to orient them using the basic techniques, so orienting bad edges 4 at a time and knowing how to handle a 2 flip. After that, implement the 'orienting 2 bad edges at the start' trick. This trick will help you in a lot of 6 flip cases, which is important, since getting 6 bad edges is the most common case.

Once you have learned the fundamental techniques, use the [crystalcube trainer](https://crystalcuber.com/train/eo) in order to implement these skills into practice. Scramble the cube and try to solve EO yourself. If you're stuck, you can uncover the first move with the slider below the cube. If you don't find the optimal solution because it was too arbitrary, that's okay. 1 move above optimal is also good, especially for a beginner. With this trainer, you'll be able to improve your efficiency and get to 4-5 move solutions on average with enough training.

### Practice EO

Start to plan EO in inspection and become familiar enough that you don't need to put fingers on bad edges (The way you'll be able to do that is by visualizing EO not as a set of individual bad edges but as 1 shape that spreads around the cube). With good, planned solutions you should be able to execute the whole EO step in under 1 second on average.

Now that you're proficient at solving EO, do a y rotation and repeat the process for the second axis. So if you knew how to solve EO from the white (or yellow) on top and green (or blue) in front, a y rotation will give you red/orange on front instead, and the EO on that axis will be different. By learning how to detect bad edges from this axis as well, you will become y neutral: that is, you'll be able to choose between 2 different Edge Orientation cases in a solve, which is very useful. Learning the second axis will be much faster as the only new thing you'll have to learn is how to detect bad edges from the other axis.

### Learn bad edge placements

This is going to develop naturally but it is also worth mentioning: Get familiar with how the bad edges get affected by F and B moves in cases when only 1/2/3 bad edges are placed on the F/B face. So for example, let's say you have 3 bad edges on the F face: in the Upper-Front, Left-Front and Right-Front places, and 1 good edge in the Down-Front place. When you do an F', you'll be left with 1 bad edge and 3 good edges, but where will the bad edge end up exactly? We had a good edge before in the Down-Front place, so after an F' it will come up to the Right-Front place and become bad, so that's our answer. In a solve, you dont want to manually think about where the bad edges will end up: this should happen automatically. This will save you time in inspection as EO will become automatic to trace in harder cases.

### Apply basic EOCross techniques

The 2 most bang-for-your-buck techniques you can learn are using different directions of F/B moves whilst orienting edges, and implementing F/B turns when there are only 2 bad edges on said F/B face. Both of these will help in influencing the cross edges. Use the movecount drill to get down to 10 moves on average, you can find the drill in the [efficiency](/improvement-guide/eocross/efficiency) article.

### Improve EOCross efficiency and planning

Practice until you can plan EO + 2 cross edges (EO+2) every time. Do lots of efficiency practice with previously mentioned drills and use [crystalcube](https://crystalcuber.com/train/eo) in order to train EOCross solutions, which will give you new ideas and improve your movecount. You want to reduce your movecount to 8.5 moves on average. Improved efficiency will in turn make it easier for you to plan EOCross in [inspection](/improvement-guide/eocross/inspection). Work on that.

### Improve EOCross speed

Now you want to focus more on the speed and execution of the step. Use the same drill as before, but this time focus on speed, so instead of typing in the movecount you type in the time. For more information, see the speed section of the [Practicing](/improvement-guide/eocross/practicing) article. Along with that, practice planning EOCross faster in inspection. 

A good goal to aim for is to plan EOCross within 8 seconds of inspection, being able to execute it in 1.5 seconds, in 9 or less moves on average. This is the skill level equivalent of a 6.5 seconds solver.

### Mastery

Continue practicing. To improve at this step most effectively, master your turning, as your biggest time losses will mainly come from lockups and slight inaccuracies here and there. Try to eliminate them entirely.

World class EOCross level is executing it in 1.2 seconds and below, and being able to plan the step in 4-6 seconds. This at the high level will give you more than enough time for planning the first pair in inspection for every scramble.
