ZBLL is an algorithm set that allows you to solve the last layer with only 1 algorithm. It is the 3rd and final step of the ZZ method. Compared to solving with [OCLL/PLL](/improvement-guide/ll/2lll), it saves 8 moves on average, and it has been widely applied in world-class solving in the CFOP method. ZBLL contains 493 algorithms. But if you already know PLL, that leaves 472 algorithms left. 
If you're up to the challenge and want to learn ZBLL, we got you covered - here's how to learn it step by step.

<Callout type="info">
  Before you begin learning ZBLL, make sure that you've already learned the 28 OCLL/PLL algorithms.

## Mindset

First off, here are 2 commonly asked questions before starting.

The first issue you might have is that there are too many algorithms to learn and that it will take a lot of time. This is the single most common addressed issue. Learning 472 algorithms is a lot, but if you dedicate yourself to learning a set of 12 cases per week, then you could learn and become proficient them all in 10 months. You might say that's a lot of time, but the time is going to pass by anyway. So if you plan on eventually learning this set, I would always recommend you to start now. If you're reading this article on the month of publication (December 2023), then you could become a great ZBLL user by October 2024.

The second concern people may have is that they do believe ZBLL is possible to learn for them, but that it would require too much work to keep the algorithms maintained and that sooner or later they'll forget them.

If you, as before stated, spend 1 week on a set of 12 algorithms, that's more than enough time to get the cases to a good speed (preferably under 1.5 seconds if you're starting out). Then after that week of practicing you could make consistent quick 3-5 minute reviews of the cases so that they stay in your muscle memory. Along with that, by just doing solves, you will be getting these cases quite frequently, since you're guaranteed on getting a ZBLL case. So by just doing that, the algorithms will stay fresh in your memory.

## Organization

In order to learn the before mentioned 12 algorithms in a week, it will best to have a structured plan on how exactly you're going to learn these 12 cases in week's time.

It depends on how quickly you want to learn the algorithms. Let's say you'll be able to go over the 12 algorithms in 3 days. Then the remaining portion of the time should be spent on practicing them by 'drilling' them, and using the ZBLL trainer. In that case, it will be the last 4 days of the week.
('drilling an alg' is basically a process doing an algorithm over and over again on your cube until it ingrains itself in your muscle memory. As for the ZBLL trainer, we'll go over it in the [Practicing ZBLL](https://www.zzmethod.com/en/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-practice) article.)

Before you start, I would highly recommend making your own ZBLL sheet to log your progress and to have your algorithms organized. How to make one? Just make a copy of a ZBLL sheet on google docs:
1. Go to an already existing Google Docs sheet with ZBLL algorithms, [this one for example](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uwmZHf4vwJxFgeB3-TiF8MQ0RFSS30d5CUK96PoIwk/edit?gid=34031343#gid=34031343)
2. Log in to an account
3. Go to File > Make a Copy
4. After you create your copy, you can now switch out the algorithms to the ones of your liking. You can clear the cells for the algorithms you haven't learned yet, that will give you an indicator on which cases you have left remaining.

With that out of the way, let's begin.

## Order of learning

We're going to learn ZBLL by the OCLL sets, the most agreed upon order is to learn the T/U sets first then L, after that cover the H and Pi sets and have the Sune and Antisune sets left for last.

(If you have no idea what these silly letters mean, each one of them represents a different OCLL case. You can find them [here](https://www.zzmethod.com/en/improvement-guide/ll/2lll)

An OCLL set has 6 different sets categorized by their Corner Permutation with 12 algorithms in each of them. This is why it has been stated before to learn 12 at once, since it's the best to learn a full set of these at a time. 

You might ask, what does Corner Permutation mean? Let's say you're going to learn the T set first. In [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uwmZHf4vwJxFgeB3-TiF8MQ0RFSS30d5CUK96PoIwk/edit?gid=34031343#gid=34031343), if you go to the 'T' tab, you can see that the algorithms are being grouped into batches of 12: like T1, T2, T3 and so on. If you look at each individual case in one batch, so take T1 for example, and just look at the pattern on the corners, you'll realize that they are all the same. For T1, that is the 2 corner stickers on the left that are facing the top having the exact same colour, with the 2 corner stickers on the right side of the cube also having the same colour. Going along, T2 has the 2 corner stickers on the left having opposite colours, with the 2 corner stickers on the right side also having opposite colours.

Each Corner Permutation case has it's own distinct pattern that you'll have to recognize. That's why I would advise on watching a video tutorial on being able to recognise these cases apart from each other: this skill is called COLL recognition. You can learn it from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI24ciRbl8BVMcz6pykWw040A40JntUrn)

Note: these videos go over not only over the recognition of these cases but also algorithms on how to do COLL, which is basically doing a specific OCLL algorithm that will also solve the corners, which will give you a Solved Corners case for PLL. You can learn them if you want as an intermediate step but you're going to go over them anyway whilst progressing through ZBLL, so this is up to you. The most important part is learning the COLL recognition and that's what you should focus on the most.

## Recognition

You'll be able to recognize the different Corner Permutation cases from each other, but you still have 12 cases in each set that you'll have to differentiate from. How to do that? There are multiple ways, but the most consistent out of all of them and the one i would recommend for beginners is called the Baum-Harris system. You can learn more about recognition [here](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-recog).

## Learning a set

Choose your algorithms by going through the [ZBLL sheets](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-algs). Try out different algorithms and check which ones work the most for you. If you're confused or indecisive, just pick the first one, simple as that. Do not overthink this process. You might fall into the trap of being too indecisive about choosing between 2 algorithms that probably have a 0.1 second difference between them at best. If you ever catch yourself in this situation, pick whichever. You can always switch out the alg later. Add them to your own google docs sheet.

Obviously after that you'll have to go on to practice these algs, so here's [everything covered for you.](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-practice)

## Maintaining a set

After you learn your batch of 12 algorithms, you will have to review it again at certain times to not forget it. This is why making a ZBLL sheet is so important, because with it you won't have to relearn an entire case again since everything is already logged on your document. In order to recall a set, you don't need to go through the whole practice process again. You can just go to your sheet, go over each case a few times, and then practice the 12 algorithms a few times on the ZBLL trainer. This will take around 5-7 minutes and can also be a great way to warmup before your solving session.

Use spaced repetition: So after learning a set, review it 3-5 times every few days and then only need to review it once a week. You're spacing out the practice and with each repetition it will take longer and longer to forget the information you've just learned.

And that's it! Your ZBLL journey will consist of learning a new ZBLL set every week, and reviewing these sets every once in a while to not forget them. Good luck on your journey!
