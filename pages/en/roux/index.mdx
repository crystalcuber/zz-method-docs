## What is Roux?

Roux (pronounced "roo") is a fast and intuitive method for solving the Rubik's Cube. [Proposed by Gilles Roux in 2003](https://www.cubinghistory.com/3x3/Methods/Roux), it works by simplifying the cube into an easier puzzle with fewer types of moves.

These are the four main steps of Roux:

<Steps>
  ### First Block (FB)
  <div className="flex sm:gap-8 mt-4 flex-col sm:flex-row">
    <TwistyPlayer
      rotateStickering="x2 y"
      controlPanel="none"
      className="size-36"
      cameraLatitude="-20"
      cameraLongitude="-30"
      experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.FB}
    />
    Build a 1x2x3 block on one side of the cube. This is done by joining pieces together with logic, no algorithms needed.
  </div>

  ### Second Block (SB)
  <div className="flex sm:gap-8 mt-4 flex-col sm:flex-row">
    <TwistyPlayer
      rotateStickering="x2 y"
      controlPanel="none"
      className="size-36"
      cameraLatitude="-20"
      cameraLongitude="30"
      experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.SB}
    />
    Build another 1x2x3 block on the opposite side.
  </div>

  ### Corners of the Last Layer (CMLL)
  <div className="flex sm:gap-8 mt-4 flex-col sm:flex-row">
    <TwistyPlayer
      rotateStickering="x2 y"
      controlPanel="none"
      className="size-36"
      cameraLatitude="20"
      cameraLongitude="30"
      experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.CMLL}
    />
    Solve the four corners on the top side with an algorithm set called CMLL.
  </div>

  ### Solve the Last Six Edges (LSE)
  <div className="flex sm:gap-8 mt-4 flex-col sm:flex-row">
    <TwistyPlayer
      rotateStickering="x2 y"
      controlPanel="none"
      className="size-36"
      cameraLatitude="20"
      cameraLongitude="30"
      experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.LSE}
    />
    <div>
    Solve the remaining 6 edges and 4 centers of the cube.
    This is all done with M and U layer moves.
    </div>
  </div>
</Steps>

## Why learn Roux?

Roux is a **fast** speedsolving method used to achieve incredible results in official competitions. Check out Crimson Arradaza's 6.05 3x3 average with Roux:

Roux is an excellent method for one-handed solving. Sean Patrick Villanueva used Roux to set his 8.09 World Record average in May of 2024.

Roux is also very **intuitive**. It encourages solving the cube with a natural thought process. It's easy to learn, and doesn't require much memorization.
