import TwistyPlayer from "components/TwistyPlayer";
import { STICKERINGS } from "lib";

The first step of the Roux Method is to solve this block on the left side of the cube:

<TwistyPlayer
  rotateStickering="x2 y"
  controlPanel="none"
  className="size-48"
  cameraLatitude="-20"
  cameraLongitude="-30"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.FB}
/>

We call that the **First Block**. Let's break it down into three smaller blocks:

// TODO: visualizer in a timeline, just call them part 1 part 2 part 3
1. Center and edge in the middle
2. Front pair
3. Back pair

## Part 1: Anchor and Center

To start, we will choose an edge piece to be the **"anchor"**: a special piece that we say is solved. All other pieces will be solved around this anchor. In this tutorial we'll choose the white-blue edge as the anchor.

Find the white-blue edge, then hold the cube so the edge's white sticker is on the bottom, and its blue sticker is on the left.

<Callout type="info">
  We will hold this anchor in the bottom-left _throughout the whole solve!_
  
  We won't make any moves that touch the anchor, such as turning the bottom or left layers.
</Callout>

Then, find the blue center on the cube. Move it to the left side, without moving the anchor. These two types of moves will come into handy:

// TODO: insert animation for Uw

// TODO: insert animation for Rw

Try it out and experiment! Below are the solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Case 1</summary>
  If the center is at the front, right or back side, you can move it to the left with one move, like this:
  <TwistyPlayer
    rotateStickering="x2 y"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIIIIDIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:I-IIII"
    experimentalSetupAlg="Uw'"
    alg="Uw"
    cameraLatitude="-20"
    cameraLongitude="-30"
    viewer-link="none"
  />
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Case 2</summary>
  If the center is at the top or bottom, you can move it to the front or back, then solve like in Case 1.
    <TwistyPlayer
    rotateStickering="x2 y"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIIIIDIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:I-IIII"
    experimentalSetupAlg="Uw' Rw"
    alg="Rw' Uw"
    cameraLatitude="20"
    cameraLongitude="-30"
    viewer-link="none"
  />
</details>

Now we have the anchor and its matching center solved! This forms a block of two pieces.

<Callout type="info">
  Once we form a block, we want to keep it together! We'll avoid moves that break apart the blocks.

  For the block that we just solved, we'll now avoid doing `Uw` moves because they break the center apart from the anchor.
</Callout>

## Part 2

Now let's form a **pair**: a matching edge and corner. We'll make a pair to expand our block into this:

TODO: DL solved and dimmed, L dimmed, DFL and FL normal. yellow top red front

We'll connect the blue-red edge with the blue-red-white corner. As we can see, those are the pieces that will expand the block.

Start by moving the blue-red edge to the **loading spot**: the bottom-front position.

IDEA FOR LATER: it can get really hard to remember which colours of pieces to solve. teach to beginners that they can use the centers as a reference. move the M slice to get the white center on the bottom. you can now figure out which pieces belong where, because you know what the solved colours are for each side.
