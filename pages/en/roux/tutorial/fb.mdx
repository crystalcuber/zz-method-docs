ok i decided its best to just have a cube basics section and link to it in every beginner guide, as opposed to "copy-pasting" the basics in every tutorial. chatgpt gave a great point which is not only does it make the site more modular, it also prevents beginners from feeling overwhelmed when they see repetitive content while checking out multiple methods.


# Introduction to the Cube

If you're new to the Rubik's Cube, this is the place to learn how the Cube works!

Let's start by revealing one of the secrets of the Cube. From the outside, the cube appears to be made of colored **stickers** that move around.

But if we take it apart, this is what we see:
TODO: image of cube taken apart, with corner center and edge labelled.


TODO: i think it's better to first explain why its not just stickers by solving side then side.
and then when it fails, we realize it's pieces
the way to teach that would be something like, let's solve one side of the cube. the layer could look something like a g-perm or something, where there are two corners that have headlights. now we wanna solve the side with headlights, we need to make the sticker in between the headlights also that same colour as the headlights. but the edge in between the two corners is made of two stickers fused together, so the only way to have both the first and the second side solved is to switch that edge out with another edge. this results in lots of redundant work, because you have to move the same pieces around multiple times.


The Cube is made of **pieces**: not just stickers, but _groups_ of stickers that move _together_. This simple fact tells us a lot about the Cube!

Here are the three types of pieces:

**Corners** are groups of three stickers.
They are always in these 8 spots, no matter how you turn.

**Edges** are groups of two stickers.
They are always in these 12 spots, and they _don't mix_ with corners! An edge won't be in a corner spot, and a corner won't be in an edge spot.

**Centers** are pieces with a single sticker.
Centers _don't move_ when you turn a side! Therefore, the color of a center tells you the solved color of its side.

To solve the Rubik's Cube, we need to move the same-color stickers to the same side. So we might try to solve the Cube, one side at a time. 

For example, if we solve the blue side first:

TODO: finish the rest of the guide


# Intro to Roux

note: this is where the storytelling begins. i want to give beginners motivation to complete this guide. this is a special guide that helps the reader understand the cube and figure out little parts of it on their own. this is different from tradition, which relies very much on brute memorization. this way is much more satisfying because you feel like you really know how you solved it.

# First Block (FB)

The first step of the Roux Method is to solve this block on one side of the cube.

<TwistyPlayer
  rotateStickering="x2 y"
  controlPanel="none"
  className="size-48"
  cameraLatitude="-20"
  cameraLongitude="-30"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits={STICKERINGS.FB}
/>

In this tutorial, we'll solve the block on the left side, with blue on the left and white on the bottom.

Let's break it down into three smaller steps:

TODO: add images
1. Solve the blue-white edge
2. Solve the pair at the front
3. Solve the pair at the back

A **pair** is a corner and edge with matching colors.

## Part 1

We'll start with the blue center. Hold the cube so the blue center is on the left. That center is now considered "solved", and we'll keep it on the left for the _entire solve_. So imagine this center is tied to your left hand.

Next, locate the blue and white edge. We want to connect it to the blue center, as shown here.

TODO: Image of blue center + DL edge

This only needs 1 or 2 moves. We encourage you to try it out and experiment.

Sometimes the edge can join with the center in a single move, like this:

TODO: examples. be sure to use random scrambles and dim all the pieces except DL, instead of just greying them out. this helps beginners get a sense that we are just ignoring other pieces.

In other cases, one move would get the edge to the left layer but flipped the wrong way. If this happens, try placing the edge into the middle layer by turning a side. Then, turn a different side to move it back to the left layer.

TODO: examples

Once we form a block, we want to avoid moves that will break it apart. For the blue center and blue-white edge, we will avoid D-layer moves from now on because they'll break the two pieces apart.

## Part 2

Now let's form a **pair**: a matching edge and corner. We'll make a pair to expand our block into this:

TODO: DL solved and dimmed, L dimmed, DFL and FL normal. yellow top red front

We'll connect the blue-red edge with the blue-red-white corner. As we can see, those are the pieces that will expand the block.

Start by moving the blue-red edge to the **loading spot**: the bottom-front position.

TODO: show DF highlighted





IDEA FOR LATER: it can get really hard to remember which colours of pieces to solve. teach to beginners that they can use the centers as a reference. move the M slice to get the white center on the bottom. you can now figure out which pieces belong where, because you know what the solved colours are for each side.
