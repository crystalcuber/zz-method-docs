Have you ever wanted to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube? You're in the right place! In this guide, we'll learn the basics of the Cube. By the end, you'll be ready to learn a solving method!

## How the Cube Works

**Stickers** are the coloured squares on the outside of the cube.

Let's start by revealing a secret of the Rubik's Cube. From the outside, it looks like a bunch of stickers moving around. But if we take it apart, there's more to see:

It's made of **pieces**, which are _groups_ of stickers that move together! There are three types of pieces:

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:--------,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Corners** are pieces that carry 3 stickers. They are always located in these 8 corner spots.
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:------------,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Edges** are pieces that carry 2 stickers. They are always located in these 12 edge spots, so they will never "mix" with corners. An edge can't move to a corner spot, and vice versa.
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:------"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Centres** carry a single sticker. They are always located in these 6 centre spots, one per side. In fact, they will never mix with each other! No matter how you turn the sides, a centre will always stay on its side.
</div>

Play around with the cube and do random turns, or use the widget below. Observe the following:
- Stickers move together in groups of pieces
- Corner, edge and centre pieces don't mix
- Centres stay on the same side when you turn the sides

{/* TODO: make this a custom component that has just a play/pause button? */}
<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalSetupAlg="R2 D' U2 B2 L2 D R2 U2 L2 U' L F D2 R2 B' D2 R D' B2 L2"
  alg="D B' L' U L2 D' L2 R2 U' R2 F2 D' R2 U2 R' B2 D L R B' F'"
  hintFacelets="none"

## Solving Goal

We can use the 
We can use what we've learned to figure out what it means to solve the Cube.

we want to reframe the goal of solving the cube from "all sides same colour" to "get every piece in its solved arrangement"

make very clear that the centres define what colour belongs solved on that side. we can't choose to solve green next to blue. centres dictate the colour to be solved on its side.

in general, the idea of stickers being attached to pieces, that imposes a restriction on how the stickers can move around. 


It seems that the goal is to solve the cube, one side at a time.
But when we try, we find a problem:
Suppose we solved the blue side, and now we want to solve the orange side.

all the pieces are unique. just look at the image before, you can see no two edges are alike. no two corners are alike.
