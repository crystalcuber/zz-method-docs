Have you ever wanted to learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube? You're in the right place! In this guide, we'll learn the basics of the cube. By the end, you'll be ready to learn a solving method!

## How the Cube Works

On the outside, the cube is covered in coloured squares called **stickers**. It seems that the cube is made of many stickers that move around.

But what does the cube look like on the inside? Let's take it apart.

  height={281}

It's made of **pieces**, which are _groups_ of stickers that move together! Stickers attached to the same piece can only move together.

  By seeing the cube as made of pieces rather than just stickers, this helps us solve
  the cube as we will see later.
</Callout>

There are three types of pieces:

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:--------,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Corners** have 3 stickers. They are always located in these 8 corner spots.
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:------------,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Edges** have 2 stickers. They are always located in these 12 edge spots. So they
  will never "mix" with corners: an edge can't move to a corner spot, and vice versa.
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:------"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Centres** have a single sticker. They are always located in these 6 centre spots,
  one per side. Centres are special: they always stay on the same side when you turn
  the sides.
</div>

Play around with the cube and do random turns, or use the widget below. Observe that:

- Stickers on the same piece move together
- Corner, edge and centre pieces don't mix
- Centres stay on the same side when you turn the sides

{/* TODO: make this a custom component that has just a play/pause button? */}

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalSetupAlg="R2 D' U2 B2 L2 D R2 U2 L2 U' L F D2 R2 B' D2 R D' B2 L2"
  alg="D B' L' U L2 D' L2 R2 U' R2 F2 D' R2 U2 R' B2 D L R B' F'"
  hintFacelets="none"
  viewerLink="none"
/>

## Solving Goal

How do we approach solving the cube?

On the surface, it seems we should move matching stickers to the same side. Form each side one-by-one. However, we run into a few problems:

We can use the
We can use what we've learned to figure out what it means to solve the Cube.

we want to reframe the goal of solving the cube from "all sides same colour" to "get every piece in its solved arrangement"

make very clear that the centres define what colour belongs solved on that side. we can't choose to solve green next to blue. centres dictate the colour to be solved on its side.

in general, the idea of stickers being attached to pieces, that imposes a restriction on how the stickers can move around.

It seems that the goal is to solve the cube, one side at a time.
But when we try, we find a problem:
Suppose we solved the blue side, and now we want to solve the orange side.

all the pieces are unique. just look at the image before, you can see no two edges are alike. no two corners are alike.
