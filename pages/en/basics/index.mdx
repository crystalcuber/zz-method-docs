In this guide, we'll learn the basics of the Rubik's Cube. By the end, you'll be ready to learn a solving method!

## How the Cube Works

Let's begin with how the cube works.

The outside of the cube is covered with coloured squares called **stickers**. It seems that the cube is simply made of many stickers that can freely move around.

But what does it look like on the inside? Here is a disassembled cube:

  width={500}
  height={281}
/>
<figcaption><em>From left to right: 12 edges, the core, and 8 corners</em></figcaption>
</figure>

The cube is made of:
- The **core**: a structure in the middle of the cube that holds the other parts together.
- **Pieces**: parts that have coloured stickers.

There are three types of pieces:

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:------"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Centres** are pieces with a single sticker. There are six of them, and 
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:------------,CORNERS:XXXXXXXX,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Edges** have 2 stickers. They are always located in these 12 edge spots. So they
  will never "mix" with corners: an edge can't move to a corner spot, and vice versa.
</div>

<div className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row">
  <TwistyPlayer
    controlPanel="none"
    className="size-36"
    experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:XXXXXXXXXXXX,CORNERS:--------,CENTERS:XXXXXX"
    hintFacelets="none"
  />
  **Corners** have 3 stickers. They are always located in these 8 corner spots.
</div>


first begin iwth the core/centres. you can see those stickers don't actually move at all, they spin fixed in place
and then the corners and edges are pieces that move around, they carry three/two stickers that can only move together.

then talk about how the pieces are all unique, each centre dictates the solved colour of its side, and each corner/edge has a place where it belongs

It's made of **pieces**, which are _groups_ of stickers that move together! Stickers attached to the same piece can only move together.

Play around with the cube and do random turns, or use the widget below. Observe that:

- Stickers on the same piece move together
- Corner, edge and centre pieces don't mix
- Centres stay on the same side when you turn the sides

{/* TODO: make this a custom component that has just a play/pause button? */}

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalSetupAlg="R2 D' U2 B2 L2 D R2 U2 L2 U' L F D2 R2 B' D2 R D' B2 L2"
  alg="D B' L' U L2 D' L2 R2 U' R2 F2 D' R2 U2 R' B2 D L R B' F'"
  hintFacelets="none"
  viewerLink="none"

## Solving Goal

How do we approach solving the cube?

On the surface, it seems we should move matching stickers to the same side. Form each side one-by-one. However, we run into a few problems:

We can use the
We can use what we've learned to figure out what it means to solve the Cube.

we want to reframe the goal of solving the cube from "all sides same colour" to "get every piece in its solved arrangement"

make very clear that the centres define what colour belongs solved on that side. we can't choose to solve green next to blue. centres dictate the colour to be solved on its side.

in general, the idea of stickers being attached to pieces, that imposes a restriction on how the stickers can move around.

It seems that the goal is to solve the cube, one side at a time.
But when we try, we find a problem:
Suppose we solved the blue side, and now we want to solve the orange side.

all the pieces are unique. just look at the image before, you can see no two edges are alike. no two corners are alike.
