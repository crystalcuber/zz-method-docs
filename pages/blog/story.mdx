Over the past several years, the ZZ method has changed a lot - this left us with many outdated resources.
The few modern resources we had were scattered across the web, making it more difficult to learn and master the method.

This website is a project designed to fix that issue.
Starting in September of 2023, we created a comprehensive learning resource, reminiscent of classic Conrad Rider and Phil Yu tutorials.
We focused on the improved, "modern" version of ZZ with EOCross and ZBLL.

## Writing the content

We wrote two main sections across 3 months:

1. A tutorial that walks through the concept of EO and the main steps of the method.
2. An improvement guide with practice drills and techniques to improve your speed.

The tutorial section was mainly written by err0rcuber and S1neWav\_.
It features a written version of err0r's existing EO tutorial.
S1neWav\_ contributed a very intuitive beginner ZZF2L method, which is the first of its kind.
It does not assume any knowledge of CFOP F2L, making it much easier for beginners to learn ZZ.

The improvement guide was written by yoruba.
He wrote an incredible number of high-quality articles based on his expertise with the ZZ Method.
It has step-by-step instructions for improving skill in each step of the method, including tutorials for EOCross and ZZF2L techniques and advice for learning ZBLL.
yoruba also devised many practice drills for targeting specific skills.

## Building the site

Let's take a deeper dive into the way we built the website.
Hopefully this will be useful for anyone looking to build a similar cubing resource.

### Requirements

We wanted ZZMethod.com to be a reliable resource that can be easily edited and accessed by community members.
All content and code of the website available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ericx20/zz-method-docs).
Anyone can contribute to it because it is open-source.
If the site ever goes down, anyone can easily republish it.

### Tools

We wrote our articles in a format called [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).
It allows us to embed widgets such as interactive Rubik's cubes and alg sheets into our plain articles.
The cubes are from [`cubing.js`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/), which features a very customizable Rubik's cube visualizer.

The website itself is generated by a tool called [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).
It conveniently generates the layout of the site, letting us focus on the articles and not the UI.
All of this is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
