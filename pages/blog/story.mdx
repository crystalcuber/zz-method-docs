## How it started

Over the past several years, the ZZ method has evolved significantly.
Solvers are now preferring EOCross over EOLine, and ZBLL is gaining popularity.
We found very few resources for this new style of ZZ.
They were also scattered across the web, making it more difficult to learn and master the method.

In September of 2023, we decided to start working on a solution to this problem.
We wanted to build a central website that would explain the basics of ZZ and how to improve with it.
We took inspiration from the legendary [Conrad Rider](http://cube.rider.biz/zz.php) and [Phil Yu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9f-uHyHeQs&list=PLD9771CF83F13B110) tutorials.

## The team

We are a team of friends and volunteers who enjoy the ZZ Method.
Here are the three initial contributors:

- [err0rcuber](https://www.youtube.com/@err0rcuber) is a software engineer and cube resource developer.
- [Yoruba](https://www.youtube.com/@yoruba7807) is a speedcuber, known for being the fastest active ZZ user.
- [S1neWav\_](https://www.youtube.com/@S1neWav_) is a speedcuber and ZZ user who knows full ZBLL.

## Building the website

We used a tool called [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) to generate the site for us.
It provides the basic UI of the site, allowing us to focus on writing the articles.
Nextra is usually used to make documentation for software, but it worked great for documenting Rubik's cube methods too!

## Writing the content

We began writing the content around September of 2023, with the goal of releasing by Halloween.

err0r started working on a tutorial section for learning each step of the method.
At the same time, Yoruba started writing articles for how to improve at each step.
However, we realized it was going to take much longer than expected.

The EO tutorial was based off err0r's existing [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxwVmTI5nGM) so that saved a lot of time.
However, it was a challenge to replicate the visuals of the video within the written version.
We needed to create interactive 3D cubes that would show how EO worked.
Thankfully, [`cubing.js`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/) is an amazing tool that helped us build these visualizations.

In the meantime, Yoruba created an ambitious list of 15 topics he wanted to cover for the improvement guide.
Then, he started writing articles at an breakneck speed, and yet the quality was up there too.
He wrote faster than err0r could add them to the site.
Yoruba wrote step-by-step instructions for improving skill in each step of the method.
It included tutorials for EOCross and ZZF2L techniques and advice for learning ZBLL.
Yoruba also shared his practice drills for targeting specific skills.

We definitely could not make the initial launch date, so we delayed it by a month.
The new target date was November 26th, and we chose it to also give S1neWav\_ some time during his holidays to contribute.

Our friend [Swagrid](https://www.youtube.com/@SwagridCubing/) filmed a video on "How to master the ZZ method" where he also graciously promoted our project.
He wanted to release the video on the 26th to complement our release.

Yoruba went full steam ahead and completed most of the improvement guide.
The tutorial section needed some help however, because ZZF2L was proving to be a challenge to explain.
We wanted our site to have a dedicated ZZF2L tutorial that did not base its explanation off CFOP F2L.
For that, we enlisted the help of S1neWav\_ to create an intuitive beginner ZZF2L method.
He also wrote an outline for the Last Layer tutorial, choosing to teach beginners OCLL and 2-look PLL.

Again, we started running out of time before our new launch day.
But this time we were really close, we only needed to delay it by a week.
We finished up the improvement guide and the beginner tutorial, adding some finishing touches.

## Launch

On December 4th, 2023 we shared our website with the world.

Swagrid released his ["How to master ZZ" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNgkGSNssxE) after delaying it for over a month just for us.
A lot of our initial traffic came from this video.

We got a lot of feedback from online ZZ users, and we spent some time adding their suggestions.
Overall, the website was well-received.
It was great to start seeing people send ZZMethod.com links whenever someone asked for help with ZZ.

## Gratitude

We want to give a big thanks to everyone who helped us along the way!

Thank you [Lucas Garron](https://garron.net/) for the `cubing.js` library.
The TwistyPlayer visualizer has enabled us to build highly visual tutorials and resources with ease.
Thanks for continuing to maintain and improve the library, and directly giving us help on using it.

[Athefre](https://sites.google.com/site/athefre), thank you for your eye-opening research on the [origins of methods](https://sites.google.com/view/methodlibrary/home), including the ZZ method.
It helped us write a more accurate introduction to ZZ.

Thanks [Swagrid](https://www.youtube.com/@SwagridCubing/) for promoting our website on your YouTube channel.
You even delayed your own upload just for us.

Shoutout to [Gen The Snail](https://www.youtube.com/@GenTheSnail) and [Fahmi Aulia Rachman](https://www.youtube.com/@UNOFahmiAR) for your suggestions to improve the site.

And finally, thanks to everyone offering feedback over various forums and social media.

## What's next?

We're planning to add more blog posts and more resources.
Stay tuned!
