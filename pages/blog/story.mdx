Over the past several years, the ZZ method has changed a lot â€“ this left us with many outdated resources.
The few modern resources we had were scattered across the web, making it more difficult to learn and master the method.

This website is a project designed to fill the gap.
Starting in September of 2023, we created a comprehensive learning resource, reminiscent of the classic [Conrad Rider](http://cube.rider.biz/zz.php) and [Phil Yu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9f-uHyHeQs&list=PLD9771CF83F13B110) tutorials.
We focused on the improved, "modern" version of ZZ with EOCross and ZBLL.

## Who we are

As of now, we have three core members on our team:

- [err0rcuber](https://www.youtube.com/@err0rcuber): software engineer.
- [yoruba](https://www.youtube.com/@yoruba7807): the fastest active ZZ user.
- [S1neWav\_](https://www.youtube.com/@S1neWav_): ZZ user with full ZBLL.

err0r saw an opportunity to improve ZZ resources.
In 2023 he bought the zzmethod.com domain and began this project with two friends, yoruba and S1neWav\_.

## Writing the content

We wrote two main sections across 3 months:

1. A tutorial that walks through the concept of EO and the main steps of the method.
2. An improvement guide with practice drills and techniques to improve your speed.

The tutorial section was mainly written by err0rcuber and S1neWav\_.
It features a written version of err0r's existing EO tutorial.
S1neWav\_ contributed a very intuitive beginner ZZF2L method, which is the first of its kind.
It does not assume any knowledge of CFOP F2L, making it much easier to learn ZZ.

The improvement guide was written by yoruba.
He wrote an incredible number of high-quality articles based on his expertise with the ZZ Method.
It has step-by-step instructions for improving skill in each step of the method, including tutorials for EOCross and ZZF2L techniques and advice for learning ZBLL.
yoruba also devised many practice drills for targeting specific skills.

The initial article drafts were written in Google Docs, in a shared Google Drive folder.
This enabled the team to easily collaborate on the articles.
Once they were ready, they were copied over to the site using [this Google Workspace plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/docs_to_markdown/700168918607).
Finally, we added 3D cubes and other interactive features.

By the time we launched our site, we wrote over 16,000 words!

## Building the site

Here is a detailed overview of the way we built the website and the tools we used.
We hope this will be useful for those looking to build a similar cubing resource.

### Goals

When choosing the technologies for ZZMethod.com, we had four goals in mind:

- A reliable, long-term resource.
- Beginner-friendly.
- Accessible.
- Open to contributions.

### Reliable

One way to make a reliable site is to build a custom, self-contained site.
All of the content and source code is in one place: on our [GitHub](https://github.com/ericx20/zz-method-docs) under an open-source license.
This means if ZZMethod.com ever goes down, anyone can re-publish it easily.
In addition, if anyone wants to make a similar website, they could see exactly how we made ours as a reference.

We use a site generator called [Nextra](https://nextra.site/).
It is primarily used to make software documentation websites, but we found it awesome for documenting cube methods too!
The site is running on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), but it can be easily deployed on many web hosting services.

### Beginner-friendly

Visuals are essential for making Rubik's cube resources beginner-friendly.
This is especially true in ZZ because EO is very visual and can be confusing at first.
We found a way to embed interactive cubes into our written guides, allowing us to match the power of video tutorials.

Our articles are written in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), a format that allows us to embed widgets into plain documents.
MDX is an extended version of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), so we first use Markdown as a convenient syntax for writing the words.
And when we want to add an interactive Rubik's cube, alg sheet or video, we can just insert a reusable [React](https://react.dev/) component onto our page
The cubes are made in [`cubing.js`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/), which features a very customizable Rubik's cube visualizer.

In addition to visuals, we carefully format our tutorials to make them easy to read.
New terms are bolded, important points are called out in colored boxes, and steps are usually in bullet points.
Additional examples are tucked away in collapsible sections, which helps prevent the tutorial from being overwhelming.

### Accessible

In the beginning, we mentioned that modern ZZ resources were scattered across the web.
Sometimes, the best resources are buried deep inside online forums or social media.
To fix this problem, we focused on making the website as easily discoverable as possible.

We optimized the website to rank higher on Google and other search engines.
Whenever people search for "zz method", our website should ideally be one of the first results you see.
This is called "Search Engine Optimization", or SEO for short.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) is the framework that Nextra uses to generate the static sites, and it has high SEO performance.
Static sites load faster and are easier for search engines to explore.
We also added a description to each article to help search engines better understand the topic.

"Accessibility" also has another meaning.
Web accessibility is the goal of making websites usable for everyone.
It is the removal of barriers that could affect users with and without disabilities when they use our site.
For example, users with motor disabilities may rely on keyboard navigation to visit pages.
Thanks to the tools we chose (Nextra and `cubing.js`), keyboard users can easily navigate to any page and play with the interactive cubes.
We have light and dark mode that matches the system preferences of users by default.
The site's layout adapts to the device's screen size, so mobile users enjoy an experience equal to desktop users.

### Open to contributions

ZZMethod.com is a community project, so it needs to be easily edited and maintained by the community.
With GitHub, anyone can provide feedback and submit contributions for review.
Non-technical users are still able to make changes because the articles are written with the simple Markdown format.
Users with experience in web dev can easily participate because we chose industry-standard tech such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), React and Next.js.

## Conclusion

And that is the story of ZZMethod.com.
This is our first blog post, we hope you enjoyed it and found it interesting.
