Welcome to ZZMethod.com! Learn the fundamentals of modern ZZ.

## What is ZZ?

ZZ is a speedsolving method for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube. Its most distinctive feature is Edge Orientation (EO): twisting the edge pieces at the start to streamline the rest of the solve.

There are three steps:

1. [**EOCross**](/tutorial/eocross): solve EO and a cross at the same time. An alternative is EOLine.
2. [**ZZF2L**](/tutorial/zzf2l): complete the First 2 Layers with R, U, L and D turns. No cube rotations required.
3. [**Last Layer**](/tutorial/ll): solve the top layer with a reduced number of cases.

The estimated average movecount is 53.5.

### Step 1: EOCross

Solve two properties in the same step:

- solve Edge Orientation: twist the edges so that they are all solvable without F or B moves.
- solve the cross: the 4 bottom edges, just like CFOP and many beginner methods.

The EO step slows down the beginning of the solve significantly, in return for benefits in the rest of the solve. It also requires more planning and inspection than CFOP cross or Roux FB.

Alternatively, you can solve EOLine (solve EO plus the bottom-front and bottom-back edges). This results in a more efficient ZZF2L, and it is well suited for one-handed solving. However, the two-handed turning speed in this type of ZZF2L is slower. We recommend using EOCross for two-handed solving.

### Step 2: ZZF2L

Complete the First 2 Layers by solving pairs of matching corners and edges together.

Because EO is solved, only R, U, L and D moves are needed. This increases turning speed because the solver can turn in a streamlined way (we call this the "ergonomics" of a step). No cube rotations are required.

If EOCross is solved, ZZF2L is similar to CFOP F2L but with fewer cases, and it is highly ergonomic. If EOLine is solved, ZZF2L is very unique, using mostly R, U and L moves to form blocks of solved pieces in an efficient way. However, it is not as ergonomic because regrips are more frequent.

### Step 3: LL

Solve the remaining Last Layer with algorithms. Solved EO reduces the number of cases significantly, making the 2-step approach easier to learn and the fastest (1-step) approach feasible to learn.

There are two main options:

- OCLL+PLL: learn 7+21=28 algorithms to solve the last layer in 2 steps.
  - Without EO solved, there would be 57+21=78 algorithms (OLL+PLL).
- ZBLL: learn 493 algorithms to solve the last layer in 1 step. This is the fastest approach and takes full advantage of ZZ.
  - Without EO solved, there would be 3916 algorithms (1LLL).

# History

ZZ was proposed in 2003 by Ryan Heise and then popularized by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. Since then, the method has evolved significantly. In recent years, the preferred EO step has changed from EOLine to EOCross, and ZBLL is becoming increasingly popular. There are also countless ZZ variants that explore different ways to finish the solve.
