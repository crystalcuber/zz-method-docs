## Self-Critique

### Pros

1. In general my solutions here for both EOCross and F2L are solid. I messed up occasionally but I mostly had good, efficient, and ergonomic solutions.
2. I have overall good efficiency. With the exception of a couple solves where I messed up, most of the solves were in the 48-54 range for movecount, which is good.

### Cons

1. I have awful F2L lookahead, I need to get better at looking away from the pair I'm solving. I usually pause between first and second pair.
2. I'm bad at finding pieces. This connects again to lookahead. I'm frequently looking to the back when I should be remembering what's in there or deducing it.
3. Some of my ZBLLs need more drilling. I should revise my algs and learn to predict AUF for the cases I don't know how to.

### Solutions

1. Do untimed solves focusing on making my F2L as smooth as possible.
2. Drill ZBLL more, especially the cases I'm struggling with.
3. Practice piece deduction using Conrad Rider's drill
