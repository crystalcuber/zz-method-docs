## Self-Critique

### Problem 1: Bad turning

My turning in this average was especially rough because I was using a different cube than normal. My main cube is pretty much dead (I maintained it poorly) so I was using this instead. I have ordered a new cube so this should be fixed soon.
Regardless, my turning is unstable and I should focus on turning with the tips of my fingers rather than the pads, and minimising motion
I can improve by drilling algs while consciously focusing on high quality turning technique

### Problem 2: AUF

I had some bad fumbles with AUF on ZBLLs. I know how to recognise AUF for all cases but for many I have forgotten how or am not confident enough which leads to mistakes.
I should practice ZBLL set-by-set to fix this, focusing specifically on not doing this.
This should be pretty easy to overcome.
