**OCLL+PLL** is an efficient method of solving the Last Layer (with edges oriented) in just 2 steps.
In total, there are only 28 algs. It's the most bang of your back way of solving the Last Layer, as it can get you to sub 7 and lower, while maintaining a very low algorithm count. If you haven't learned ZBLL yet, use this method.

CFOP users will already know all of these, even with 2-look OLL.

## Step 1: OCLL

**O**rient the **C**orners of the **L**ast **L**ayer: twist the top corners so the top side is a single color.

This set has 7 algorithms. Recognize the case by the pattern of the top-colored stickers on the corners. Everything else is ignored.

## Step 2: PLL

**P**ermute the **L**ast **L**ayer: swap the top pieces around to solve the cube.

This set has 21 algorithms. To recognize the case, look for these distinct features of each PLL:

- **Blocks:** rectangular chunks of matching pieces.
- **Headlights:** pairs of matching corner stickers on the same side.
- **Adjacent colors:** colors belonging to sides next to each other on a solved cube (e.g. red/green).
- **Opposite colors:** colors belonging to sides across from each other on a solved cube (e.g. red/orange)
