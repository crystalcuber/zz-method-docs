**OCLL+PLL** is an efficient method of solving the Last Layer (with edges oriented) in just 2 steps:

1. Orient the corners of the Last Layer with one of the 7 OCLL algorithms.
2. Solve the cube with one of the 21 PLL algorithms.

It's the most bang of your back way of solving the Last Layer, as it can get you to sub 7 and lower, while maintaining a very low algorithm count. If you haven't learned ZBLL yet, use this method.

Here are the best algorithms:
