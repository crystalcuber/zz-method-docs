So you want to learn ZBLL? We got you covered - here's how to learn it step by step.

## Mindset

First off, let's debunk a few common negative beliefs that you may have before continuing.

_Too many algs:_ single most common addressed issue. The truth is that the most bang for your buck would be learning ZBLL without sune and antisune, which is 328 algs. That still may seem a lot, but if you dedicate yourself to learning a set of 12 algs per week, then you could learn and master them all in 7 months. If you're reading this article on the month of publication (December 2023), then you could become a great ZBLL user by July 2024.

_Can't maintain:_ now people might say that ZBLL is possible to learn, but that it would require too much work to keep the algorithms drilled.

If you, as before stated, spend a week on a set, that's more than enough time to get the algs to a good speed (sub 1.5 at least, preferably sub 1.2). Then after that week of grinding you could make consistent quick 3-5 minute reviews of the cases so that they stay in your muscle memory. Along with that, by just doing solves, you will be getting these cases quite frequently, since you're guaranteed on getting a ZBLL case. So by just doing that, the algorithms will stay fresh in your memory.

Now I'm telling you to learn a set in a week, but how should you structure that week?

It depends on how quickly you want to learn the algs, but let's say you will learn a set in 3 days. Then the remaining 4 days will be spent on practicing this set by alg drilling, using the ZBLL trainer, etc.

Before you start, I would highly recommend making your own ZBLL sheet to keep your algs organized. How to make one? Just make a copy of an already existing ZBLL sheet on google docs, and switch out the algorithms to the ones of your liking.

With that out of the way, let's begin.

## Order of learning

We're going to learn ZBLL by the OCLL sets, the most agreed upon order is T/U, L, H/Pi.

Then for each OCLL set, the preferable way to learn is by practicing the 2GLL set first, then the Diag set, and finally the 4 remaining adjacent sets.

The reason for this path of learning is that you're starting with the sets that are the most beneficial to learn, that way by learning them first you're going to have them practiced and drilled in your memory the most.

## Recog

Of course, you also need to know how to recognize the cases from each other. There are multiple ways, but the most consistent is Baum-Harris. Learn more about recog [here](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-recog).

## Learning a set

Choose your algorithms by going through the [ZBLL sheets](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-algs). Try out different algs and check which ones work the most for you. Just a tip: do not overthink this process. You might fall into the trap of being too indecisive about choosing between 2 algs that probably have a 0.1 difference between them at best. If you ever catch yourself in this situation, pick whichever. You can always switch out the alg later. Add them to your own sheet.

To practice these algs, here's [everything covered for you.](/improvement-guide/ll/zbll-practice)

## Maintaining a set

After you learn a set, you will have to review it again at certain times to not forget it. You don't need to go through the whole practice process again, but you want to address through the following: muscle memory of the algs, alg-case connection, AUF stickers. This can take you 3-5 minutes if you have made a zbll sheet beforehand.

Use spaced repetition: So after learning a set, review it daily for 5 days, then 3 times every 2 days, then you only need to review it once a week. This is called spaced repetition.

And that's it! Your ZBLL journey will consist of learning a new ZBLL set every week, and reviewing these sets every once in a while to not forget them. Good luck on your journey!
