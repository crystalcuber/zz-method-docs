## Turning

An essential skill for EOCross is the ability to execute solutions involving many different types of moves. Thatâ€™s why we need to adapt a repertoire of fingertricks, especially for executing F/B moves. Be able to do:

- U/D flicks
- U2/D2 flicks (or get very good at double single flicks, Max Park style)
- U/D pushes
- U drags
- Being able to do U and D moves at the same time
- F moves with thumbs
- Rolling R/R2/L/L2 moves

Then for F/B moves in general, execute them as U/D from the thumb on top/bottom grip.

Keep in mind that what you should prioritize is accurate turning. This will eliminate cube lockups, which result in biggest time losses.

## Movecount

The **Movecount Drill** has helped many people and the writer of this article used it singlehandedly drop his movecount from 10.5 to 8.5. First, set up your CSTimer settings:

1. Go to [CSTimer](https://cstimer.net/).
2. Click on the gear in the top left corner.
3. Go to the 'Timer' section
4. In the 'entering in times with' box, change the setting from 'timer' to 'typing'. \

Now you're ready. The drill itself is very simple:

1. Scramble the cube.
2. Solve EOCross, and count how many moves it took you. Type that as a time with 2 zeros (so if it took you 15 moves, type 1500).
3. Solve the rest of the cube.

If you haven't done this drill, repeat it 50 times to get a sense of your average movecount.

Now that you have your average movecount, you want to set your target movecount. It should be set 2 moves below your average movecount.

After a certain amount of solves in the session (12, 25, 50) you want to go over every scramble above the target movecount. You want to repeat the scramble for these and find a solution that is below that target movecount. This will force you to try different approaches to the hardest scrambles and to apply techniques you have learned and the previously mentioned approaches. Try solving different EO+2s that give out a more efficient solution, or maybe try a different approach.

If you're really stuck, go to Solvers > EOCross to see what the computer will give you (for x2y, check the first 4 solutions). What 2 first edges does it solve, how does it deal with EO, what approach does it use? You can also use these to find other techniques that you haven't considered

Continue doing this drill until you get to averaging 8 moves, 7-8 moves max. Then, stop caring about movecount and focus on speed. Here's some tips to solve your EOCross faster:

## Solutions

- Get rid of the 'too high movecount' mindset. The goal is to solve as fast as possible, not to be as efficient as possible. If you see a 10 or an 11 move solution that can be done quickly, go for it.
- Don't go for solutions that have a lot of F2/B2 moves. In your solution, one such move is fine, two such moves should be reasonably justified and never do them 3 times or more.
- [Color neutrality](/improvement-guide/eocross/color-neutrality) helps a lot here. CN and x2y solvers will have a lot of advantage over fixed solvers for being able to choose between multiple options.
- Simplicity is key, you will find that more simple solutions, with 1-2 moves less efficient will actually be the best for TPS. This will also help in inspection, so that you don't have to spend more time than necessary planning the EOCross. \
  Ok, so why have you gotten through the hassle of improving our movecount to such a level and learning these techniques if the simpler solutions are better for speed? \
  Because we still want to know how to deal with the harder scrambles, and not every solution will be obvious. Also, more often than not, move efficient solutions turnout to be more ergonomic. We just don't want to do a computer optimal solution with horrid ergonomics when there's a much faster option for 1-2 moves sacrifice.
- The first move is important. With stackmat, it will be preferable for the first move you do to be a U/D move. If your solution starts with an F/B move, just rotate x/x' before a solve to make this move U/D. As for which moves are the best to start: It depends on the grip, but generally, U/D and single R/L moves are the best, with F/B moves on the same level (if executed from a rotation away as stated before), and finally R2/L2 moves.
- Prioritize solutions with triggers in them.

## Execution

- Go over the [Solutions](#solutions) section above. Better solutions will of course be better executed.

- Work on your turning. Apply the tips and fingertricks from the [Turning](#turning) section so that you are able to turn fast and accurately in solves with some practice. Accuracy is far more important, as locking up on a move is worse than turning slightly slower.
- In your solutions, find strings of moves that could be done like a trigger.

  For example, `B' R2 B'`: You can either: Start with thumb on bottom, do `B'` with right ring, `R2`, and then `B'` with right index. Or the opposite: Start with thumb on top, do `B'` with right index, `R2'`, do `B'` with right ring.

- Reduce the amount of regrips you do. Make sure that you're not doing any unnecessary regrips during your solution, if you think you regrip too much, go over the solution that you have done. The best thing you could do is to learn multiple fingertricks for U/D moves in different grips so that you don't have to switch to a specific grip to do U/D/F/B moves, for example B' like in the example previously mentioned. Refer to the [Turning](#turning) section to see if you can apply any to reduce the regrip count, as well as try different grips to see if you can execute a set of moves faster. \
  \
  Then do the Movecount Drill again, but this time, input the time that you have gone from solving the EOCross from stackmat (if you have it plugged in, that's even better). A good goal to aim for will be around 2/9 of your solve time: So if you average 9 seconds, aim for a 2 second EOCross with pickup.
