## Introduction

EOCross is the first step of the modern ZZ method.
We solve two properties:

- [Edge Orientation](/tutorial/eo).
- The **cross:** the 4 edges at the bottom.

A solved EOCross looks like this:

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickering="EOcross"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
/>

The turquoise stickers are there to show the orientation of the unsolved edges.
Good edges have turquoise on the ["purple orbit"](/tutorial/eo#orbits).
We can see that they're all good.

### What's the purpose of EOCross?

EOCross slows down the beginning of the solve compared to just solving CFOP cross.
However, EOCross sets up a rotationless, ergonomic F2L step.
With EO solved, there is a simpler way to [deduce](/improvement-guide/zzf2l/deduction) F2L edges.
Last Layer also becomes simpler.
OLL and PLL is easier to learn for ZZ (28 algs instead of 78), or you can learn full ZBLL and use it every solve.

In this tutorial, we'll solve EO first and then cross separately. For speed, you can later learn how to solve this as one step in the [Improvement Guide](/improvement-guide/eocross).

## Step 1: EO

The first step is to solve edge orientation. This process is explained in our [EO tutorial](/tutorial/eo).

## Step 2: Cross

Once EO is done, solve the four cross edges.
They all belong on the bottom, and are the only edges that have the bottom color.
All you need are the "natural" R, U, L, and D moves, and you can also use `F2` and `B2`.
Avoid moves that disrupt EO such as cube rotations, quarter-turn F/B-layer moves and slice moves.

There are two things needed for the cross:

### Edges are at the bottom

Here's a simple way to move each cross edge to the bottom layer.
The edge will either be on the left, middle or right layer of the cube.

- If it's on the left, do an L-layer move to bring it to the bottom.
- If it's in the middle layer, do `F2` or `B2`, depending if the edge is at the top-front or top-back position respectively.
- If it's on the right, do an R-layer move to bring it to the bottom.

<summary>Examples</summary>
For example, this edge on the right. To move it down, we can do `R'`. Press ▶️ to see:

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII-IIIIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 U' R'"
  alg="R'"
  background="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
/>

Here's an edge in the middle layer. To move it down, we can do `F2` because it's at the top-front:

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIIII-IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="L2 U'"
  alg="F2"
  background="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
/>
</details>

Sometimes, there will be a bottom cross piece that will get "kicked out" when you move another edge to the bottom.
This can be avoided by doing a D-layer turn to move the bottom cross piece out of the way.
To move this green-yellow edge to the bottom, we can first do `D'` to move the red-yellow edge out of the way. Then we can do the `R'`.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII--IIIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="D R D'"
  alg="D' R'"
  background="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
/>

Now we know how to move any cross edge to the bottom.
We can just put all cross edges on the bottom, and it'll look like this.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  background="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
  experimentalSetupAlg="D2 R D R' D' R"
/>

However, this is not a solved cross!
The cross edges are in the wrong order, they're not solved.

### Edges are in the correct order

The other requirement is to have the edges in the "correct order".
Two or more edges are in the **correct order** if they're either solved, or just one D move away from being solved.

For example, these two cross edges are in the correct order.
They are a `D` move away from solved.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIII--IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  background="none"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
  experimentalSetupAlg="D'"
  alg="D"
/>

We can see why the order is correct in another way: the red center is to the left of the blue center.
So the cross edge with red must be to the left of the cross edge with blue.

### How to solve the cross

To solve the cross, we move the edges to the bottom so they are in the correct order.
We can start by putting one cross edge at the bottom, in any position.

It's easier to see with an example. Do this scramble with the white center at the top, green center at the front:
`F2 D2 L2 U F2 R'`

In this example, we can start with the green-white cross edge.
`L2` moves it to the bottom.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 D2 L2 U F2 R'"
  alg="L2"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="-30"
/>
<span>Move: `L2`</span>

Then, we move another cross edge down.
But we should turn the D layer so that it lands in the correct order with the first edge.

Back to our example, we'll choose the **blue**-yellow edge right in front of us.
If we moved it down right now (with `F2`), it would be next to the **green**-yellow edge.
But the **blue** and **green** side colors don't belong next to each other.
Look around the cube, you'll see that the blue center is on the opposite side to the green center.

So to ensure the blue-yellow edge is placed opposite to the green-yellow edge, do a `D'` move.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 D2 L2 U F2 R' L2"
  alg="D' F2"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="-30"
  cameraLatitude="-15"
/>
<span>Moves: `D' F2`</span>

You can see they're now in the correct order. The two cross edges are a `D2` move away from solved.

Continue moving the remaining edges to the bottom like this.
In our example, we can look at the right side and see the **orange**-yellow edge.
If we put it down now with `R` then it will already be in the right order.
It'll be to the right of the **blue**-yellow edge.
We can see that the orange center is to the right of the blue center, so this is a good order.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 D2 L2 U F2 R' L2 D' F2"
  alg="R"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="30"
  cameraLatitude="-15"
/>
<span>Move: `R`</span>

Now that three cross edges are solved, it's very easy to see the empty spot where the last one must go.
The last one (red-yellow) goes down with a `B2`.
That would kick one of the other cross edges out, so we first do `D'` so red-yellow goes down in the empty spot.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 D2 L2 U F2 R' L2 D' F2 R"
  alg="D' B2"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="30"
  cameraLatitude="15"
/>
<span>Moves: `D' B2`</span>

Finally, align the cross to solve it completely.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="F2 D2 L2 U F2 R' L2 D' F2 R D' B2"
  alg="D'"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="30"
  cameraLatitude="-15"
/>
<span>Move: `D'`</span>

Now you know how to solve EOCross!

## Tips for EOCross

Here are some helpful tips for EOCross.

### Troubleshooting

If you find that edges are unsolvable or end up twisted in their spot, it means EO is not complete yet.
Make sure that all edges are good before solving cross.

### Tip for edges at the top

If a cross edge is at the top, sometimes you can save moves by turning the top layer before placing it (versus turning the bottom layer).

Take this situation: three cross edges are already solved. `R2` moves the last one down, but we do `D2` first so it will land in the right order.
Then we do `D2` to align the cross.

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="L2 U2"
  alg="D2 R2 D2"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="30"
  cameraLatitude="15"
/>
<span>Moves: `D2 R2 D2`</span>

However, in this case it's better to do a `U2` to move the last cross edge above where it should go.
Then we'll put it down with `L2`. We skip a move, because the cross is already aligned!

<TwistyPlayer
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIII----IIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII"
  experimentalSetupAlg="L2 U2"
  alg="U2 L2"
  background="none"
  cameraLongitude="30"
  cameraLatitude="15"
/>
<span>Moves: `U2 L2`</span>

With experience, you will start to see where this strategy can save moves or even make the fingertricks easier.
U moves are easier to perform than D moves.

### Influencing

Once you are comfortable with EOCross, you can improve your solutions with a technique called **influencing**.
This means changing your EO solution to make the resulting cross better.
Start paying attention to the direction of F and B turns during EO (deciding between F and F' for example).

Here are some examples of basic influencing:

- [Example 1: some influencing](https://alpha.twizzle.net/edit/?setup-alg=F%27+R2+F2+L%27+F2+L%27+U2+R+F2+U2+R+U+B+L2+D2+F+R%27+B%27+F2&alg=%2F%2F+EO+%28with+some+influencing%29%0AD%27+B+U+R%27+%2F%2F+D%E2%80%99+B+puts+3+edges+on+B+face+then+orients+them%2C+U+R%E2%80%99+puts+the+last+4+bad+edges+on+F+face%0AF+%2F%2F+we+do+F+instead+of+F%E2%80%99+because+it+places+blue+and+green+edges+relative+to+each+other+and+places+green+and+orange+edges+relative+to+each+other%0A%2F%2F+Cross%0AR%27+L2+D+L2&stickering=EOcross)

There are many forms of influencing, [click here](/improvement-guide/eocross/efficiency#influencing) for more details.

## What's next?

We suggest doing some untimed EOCross solves to become more familiar.
The next step is [Last Layer](/tutorial/ll).
