# Edge Orientation (EO)

Here's a video! Below is the written version with more details.

<YouTubeEmbed embedId="fxwVmTI5nGM" />

## Introduction

**Edge Orientation (EO)** is the way edge pieces are twisted on the cube. This is the key concept to Step 1.

**"Solving" EO** means twisting the edges in a certain way to make the rest of the solve nicer. It feels like magic!

  Not only is EO the foundation of ZZ, it's very useful for CFOP and essential
  to FMC!
</Callout>

## 1. How EO works

There are two ways an edge piece can be twisted, or **"oriented"** on the cube.

One orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z F'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

The other orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z R U"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

Why does this matter? If all edges are twisted a specific way, we can use **_natural moves_** to speed up the rest of the solve.

### Natural moves

There are six basic kinds of moves on the cube. R, U, L, D, F and B moves.
We can split them into two groups:

1. **Natural moves**: All R, U, L, and D moves. Let's call them "natural" because they're fast and comfortable for your hands.<br/>
   _Examples: R, D2, L', U_

2. **Unnatural moves**: All F and B moves. Let's call them "unnatural" because they're more awkward (unless in specific hand positions).<br/>
   _Examples: F, B', F2_

In a good speedsolving method, we want to use many natural moves and few unnatural moves.
But that begs the question: can we use _only_ natural moves to solve the whole cube?

Almost! This is the closest we can get, usually something like this:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="D2 F2 D R2 U' R2 F2 D F2 L2 D2 R' B D L' D R F2 L'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:-D-DD-DD-DDD,CORNERS:DDDDDDDD,CENTERS:DDDDDD"
/>

With _only_ natural moves, we can solve the corners and move the edges to the right place.
But the problem is that **natural moves can't twist edges**.
Some edges could be solved just fineüëç, but others remain twisted wrongüëé.

Remember how each edge has two possible orientations?
It turns out that one of them is "good", and the other is "bad".

- üëç**Good edge**: oriented in a way that's solvable with natural moves
- üëé**Bad edge**: oriented in the other way, which is **un**solvable with natural moves

### The purpose of EO

The idea of ZZ is to add a step at the beginning of the solve:

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  Twist all bad edges so they become good edges.
</Callout>

This is called **solving EO**, or **orienting the edges**. Then the whole cube can be solved with natural moves
only! Solving EO eliminates the need for F/B moves or cube rotations, allowing us to turn in a fast and streamlined way.

Plus, EO reduces the number of cases you'll encounter during the solve.

- Unlocks realistic 1-look last layer (ZBLL)
- Makes 2-look last layer (OCLL+PLL) easier to learn

### Orbits

Earlier, we discovered that natural moves can't twist edges. Why is that?

When doing R, U, L, D turns on the cube, the edge stickers move in a restricted way.
(Stickers are the coloured tiles on the cube.)

Here we have a green-red edge. Let's press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è and watch the green sticker, see where it can move.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="R3' U3 U' L3 L' D3 D' R"
  background="none"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalHintSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
/>

The green sticker can only visit the region of spots marked with purple below.
It can't visit the region of spots marked with X. The red sticker is the opposite!
We call these two regions "orbits".

<TwistyPlayer
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/orbits.png"
  experimentalHintSprite="/assets/orbits.png"
/>

The spots marked in purple, let's call it the **purple orbit**.
It covers all the edge stickers on the **U**p and **D**own sides, plus two on the **F**ront and two on the **B**ack.
Remember this, it's important later!

The rest are marked with an X, so let's call that the **outer orbit**.

During natural moves, the stickers on one orbit will always stay on that orbit.
Press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to see!

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="R L' D2 U L D' R2 U'"
  background="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/orbits.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

Also notice that every edge has one sticker in the purple orbit, and the other sticker in the outer orbit.
For example, this bad edge has a red sticker in the purple orbit, and a green sticker in the outer orbit.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' U' R'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

In order to twist this edge, we must switch red and green around.
But that means red (on the purple orbit) must move to where green was (on the outer orbit), which is impossible with natural moves!
_That's why natural moves can't twist edges._

This explains why the edge is "bad".
It's only solvable if we use unnatural moves, which are the only moves that can move stickers between orbits.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' U' R'"
  background="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

We can do `F' U' R'` to twist the front-right edge.
The `F'` changed the orientation of the bad edge, making it a good edge solvable with natural moves (`U' R'` in this case).

We call this process **orienting an edge**: turning a bad edge into a good edge with an unnatural move.
Our goal is to orient all of the edges.

But how can we tell that an edge is bad or good?
If an edge is in its solved place but twisted wrong, it's definitely bad (natural moves can't twist edges!)
But what if it were somewhere else? Not as obvious.

In the next section, we'll learn a simple system to detect these bad edges.
And after that, how we can orient them all.

## 2. Recognizing bad edges

### Perspective

When looking for bad edges around the cube, there is a problem: edge orientation depends on your perspective!
If you turn the whole cube around, some edges can change from bad to good or good to bad.
For example, if you do a `y` cube rotation, F moves (unnatural) become L moves (natural).
So a bad edge that needs to be solved with F becomes a good edge that can be solved with L.

<Callout type="info">
  This is how CFOP orients edges during F2L! If you use CFOP, recognizing EO
  helps eliminate unnecessary `y` rotations. Learn more
  [here](https://example.com)
</Callout>

In order to recognize bad edges, we should not turn the cube around.
For each solve, pick a center to stay at the top, and another to stay at the front.

Now we're ready to recognize bad edges! Follow along with this scramble:<br/>
`F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R'`

When following scrambles, always have the white center at the top, green center at the front.
After that, we can choose how to hold the cube. For example, orange center top, green center front.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R' z"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/eo-example-1-1.png"
/>

We have two rules for finding bad edges:

### Rule #1

**Rule #1**: look for **L and R stickers on the purple orbit**. Their edges are bad.

"L and R stickers" means the stickers that match the color of **L**eft and **R**ight centers.
In our example, we're looking for yellow and white stickers on the purple orbit.
Edges with those stickers are bad.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R' z"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/eo-example-1-2.png"
/>

- On the **U**p side, there's a white sticker so its edge (‚¨úüü©) is bad.
- At the **F**ront two spots, there are no whites/yellows.
- On the **D**own side, there's one white and one yellow so we found two more bad edges (‚¨úüü¶, üü®üü•).
- At the **B**ack two spots, there are no whites/yellows.

We found three bad edges so far, let's mark them with tape.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R' z"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/eo-example-1-3.png"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
  cameraLongitude="150"
/>

### Rule #2

**Rule #2**: Look for **U and D stickers on the outer orbit**. Their edges are bad.

In our example, we're looking for orange and red stickers on the outer orbit.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R' z"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/eo-example-1-4.png"
/>

- On the **L**eft side, there are no oranges/reds.
- At the **F**ront two spots, there's a red sticker so üü•üü© is the 4th bad edge.
- On the **R**ight side, there's an orange sticker so üüßüü¶ is the 5th bad edge.<br/>
  (The red sticker is on an edge we already know is bad.)
- At the **B**ack two spots, there's an orange sticker so üüßüü© is the 6th bad edge.

We've found all 6 bad edges! Here they are.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' R' D B U2 R' U R D2 L B2 R L U2 F2 B2 L B2 R' z"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/eo-example-1-5.png"
  cameraLatitude="-30"
  cameraLongitude="150"
/>

<Callout type="info">
  There will always be an even number of bad edges, from 0 to 12.
</Callout>

### Rules explained

The two rules seem magical. Why do they work?

Rule #1: L and R stickers on the purple orbit indicate bad edges.
This is because on a solved cube, the L and R stickers belong to the outer orbit.
But if we see them on the purple orbit, there's no way to bring them into the outer orbit with natural moves.
We must use unnatural moves to solve these stickers, so their edges are bad.

For rule #2, it's the same logic. U and D stickers on the outer orbit indicate bad edges.
On a solved cube, they belong to the purple orbit.
