## Introduction

**Edge Orientation (EO)** is the way edge pieces are twisted on the cube. This is the key concept to Step 1.

**"Solving" EO** means twisting the edges in a certain way to make the rest of the solve nicer. It feels like magic!

  Not only is EO the foundation of ZZ, it's very useful for CFOP and essential

## 1. How EO works

There are two ways an edge piece can be twisted, or **"oriented"** on the cube.

One orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z F'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

The other orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z R U"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

Why does this matter? If all edges are twisted a specific way, we can use **_natural moves_** to speed up the rest of the solve.

### Natural moves

There are six basic kinds of moves on the cube. R, U, L, D, F and B moves.
We can split them into two groups:

1. **Natural moves**: All R, U, L, and D moves. Let's call them "natural" because they're fast and comfortable for your hands.<br/>
   _Examples: R, D2, L', U_

2. **Unnatural moves**: All F and B moves. Let's call them "unnatural" because they're more awkward (unless in specific hand positions).<br/>
   _Examples: F, B', F2_

In a good speedsolving method, we want to use many natural moves and few unnatural moves.
But that begs the question: can we use _only_ natural moves to solve the whole cube?

Almost! This is the closest we can get, usually something like this:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="D2 F2 D R2 U' R2 F2 D F2 L2 D2 R' B D L' D R F2 L'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:-D-DD-DD-DDD,CORNERS:DDDDDDDD,CENTERS:DDDDDD"
/>

With _only_ natural moves, we can solve the corners and move the edges to the right place.
But the problem is that **natural moves can't twist edges**.
Some edges could be solved just fineüëç, but others remain twisted wrongüëé.

Remember how each edge has two possible orientations?
It turns out that one of them is "good", and the other is "bad".

- üëç**Good edge**: oriented in a way that's solvable with natural moves
- üëé**Bad edge**: oriented in the other way, which is **un**solvable with natural moves

### The purpose of EO

The idea of ZZ is to add a step at the beginning of the solve:

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  Twist all bad edges so they become good edges.
</Callout>

This is called **solving EO**, or **orienting the edges**. Then the whole cube can be solved with natural moves
only! Solving EO eliminates the need for F/B moves or cube rotations, allowing us to turn in a fast and streamlined way.

Plus, EO reduces the number of cases you'll encounter during the solve.

- Unlocks realistic 1-look last layer (ZBLL)
- Makes 2-look last layer (OCLL+PLL) easier to learn

### Orbits

Earlier, we discovered that natural moves can't twist edges. Why is that?

When doing R, U, L, D turns on the cube, the edge stickers move in a restricted way.
(Stickers are the coloured tiles on the cube.)

Here we have a green-red edge. Let's press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è and watch the green sticker, see where it can move.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="R3' U3 U' L3 L' D3 D' R"
  background="none"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalHintSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
/>

The green sticker can only visit the region of spots marked with purple below.
It can't visit the region of spots marked with an X. The red sticker is the opposite!
We call these two regions "orbits".

<TwistyPlayer
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/orbits.png"
    experimentalHintSprite="/assets/orbits.png"

/>

The spots marked in purple, let's call it the **purple orbit**.
It covers all the edge stickers on the **U**p and **D**own sides, plus two on the **F**ront and two on the **B**ack.
Remember this, it's important later!

The rest are marked with an X, so let's call that the **outer orbit**.

During natural moves, the stickers on one orbit will always stay on that orbit.
Press ‚ñ∂Ô∏è to see!

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="R L' D2 U L D' R2 U'"
  background="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/orbits.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

Also notice that every edge has one sticker in the purple orbit, and the other sticker in the outer orbit.
For example, this bad edge has a red sticker in the purple orbit, and a green sticker in the outer orbit.

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' U' R'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

In order to twist this edge, we must switch red and green around.
But that means red (on the purple orbit) must move to where green was (on the outer orbit), which is impossible with natural moves!
_That's why natural moves can't twist edges._

This explains why the edge is "bad": it's only solvable if we use unnatural moves:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="F' U' R'"
  background="none"
  experimentalStickering="picture"
  experimentalSprite="/assets/FR-edge.png"
  experimentalSetupAnchor="end"
/>

We can do `F' U' R'` to twist the front-right edge.
The `F'` changed the orientation of the bad edge, making it a good edge solvable with natural moves (`U' R'` in this case).

We call this process **orienting an edge**: turning a bad edge into a good edge with an unnatural move.
Our goal is to orient all of the edges.

But how can we tell that an edge is bad or good?
If an edge is in its solved place but twisted wrong, it's definitely bad (natural moves can't twist edges!)
But what if it were somewhere else? Not as obvious.

In the next section, we'll learn a simple system to detect these bad edges.
And after that, how we can orient them all.

## 2. Recognizing bad edges
