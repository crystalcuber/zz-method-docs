# Edge Orientation (EO)

Here's a video! Below is the written version.

<YouTubeEmbed embedId="fxwVmTI5nGM" />

## Introduction

**Edge Orientation (EO)** is the way edge pieces are twisted on the cube. This is the key concept to Step 1.

**"Solving" EO** means twisting the edges in a certain way to make the rest of the solve nicer. It feels like magic!

## How EO works

There are two ways an edge piece can be twisted, or **"oriented"** on the cube.

One orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z F'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

The other orientation:

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="x2 z R U"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  hintFacelets="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:IIIIII-IIIII,CORNERS:IIIIIIII,CENTERS:IDIIDD"
/>

Why does this matter? If all edges are twisted a specific way, we can use **_natural moves_** to speed up the rest of the solve.

### Natural moves

There are six basic kinds of moves on the cube. R, U, L, D, F and B moves.
We can split them into two groups:

1. **Natural moves**: All R, U, L, and D moves. Let's call them "natural" because they're fast and comfortable for your hands.  
   _Examples: R, D2, L', U_

2. **Unnatural moves**: All F and B moves. Let's call them "unnatural" because they're more awkward (unless in specific hand positions).  
   _Examples: F, B', F2_

In a good speedsolving method, we want to use many natural moves and few unnatural moves.
But that begs the question: can we use _only_ natural moves to solve the whole cube?

Almost! This is the closest we can get...

<TwistyPlayer
  alg="D2 F2 D R2 U' R2 F2 D F2 L2 D2 R' B D L' D R F2 L'"
  background="none"
  controlPanel="none"
  experimentalStickeringMaskOrbits="EDGES:-D-DD-DD-DDD,CORNERS:DDDDDDDD,CENTERS:DDDDDD"
/>

With _only_ natural moves, we can solve the corners and move the edges to the right place.
But the problem is that **natural moves can't twist edges**.
Some edges could be solved just fineüëç, but others remain twisted wrongüëé.

Remember how each edge has two possible orientations?
Turns out one of them is "good", and the other is "bad".

- üëç**Good edge**: it's oriented in way that's solvable with natural moves
- üëé**Bad edge**: it's oriented in the other way, which is **un**solvable with natural moves

### The purpose of EO

The idea of ZZ is to add a step at the beginning of the solve:

<Callout type="info" emoji="üí°">
  Twist all bad edges so they become good edges.
</Callout>

This is called **solving EO**, or **orienting the edges**. Then the whole cube can be solved with natural moves
only!

F/B moves or cube rotations are not required, allowing us to turn in a fast, streamlined way.

### Orbits

Earlier, we discovered that natural moves can't twist edges. But why?
