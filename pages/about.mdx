ZZMethod.com is the modern, complete guide to the ZZ Method.

## Modern

ZZ has evolved since its proposal in 2003. In recent years, EOCross has become the dominant EO step, but resources have not caught up. This website is the first to fully document "Modern ZZ", the way it is practiced now.

We present an innovative EO tutorial that makes EO intuitive and easy to learn. It goes beyond stating the rules of how to solve it, by showing how the rules emerge from a simple concept. It uses animated 3D cubes from [`cubing.js`](https://js.cubing.net/cubing/twisty/) to visualize how EO works.

## Complete

This site has everything needed to excel with modern ZZ. We have an in-depth tutorial walking through each step of the method.

We feature a very comprehensive improvement guide written by [Yoruba](https://youtube.com/@yoruba7807), a sub-8 ZZ solver. It covers advanced techniques and practical advice for improving with the method.

Modern ZZ has been difficult to learn because key resources were scattered or didn't exist. We are filling the gap, inspired by the classic tutorials of [Conrad Rider](http://cube.rider.biz/zz.php) and [Phil Yu](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD9771CF83F13B110).
